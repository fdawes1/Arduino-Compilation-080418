Make a MIDI controller using salvaged logarthimic slide potentiometers from old analog audio gear.

An Arduino Pro Micro was used for this project.
A 74HC4051 analog multiplexer was used to add additional inputs.

Compilation note:
- Requires Ralf Kistner's arcore patch (adds MIDI-USB support) into Arduino IDE enviroment to compile.
